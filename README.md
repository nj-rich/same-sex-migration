Welcome to this repository! This repository was built for a project assigned in the University of Michigan course, Economics 495. In this class, students write an original economics research paper.

For my project, I am extending a paper by Drs. Marcen and Morales, concerning the inter-state migration of individuals in same-sex relationships in the US. The paper and I use publicly accessible Census ACS data from IPUMS. This is the only data set used in the project not stored in this repository. To analyze the data, the paper and I use code originally published by Dr Justin Wolfers. That code, with my modifications, can be found here.

In the Code folder, you can find 'data_cleaning.Rmd' which cleans the IPUMS CPS data so that it can be useful for the project (IPUMS ACS data contains individual-level observations, while I am interested in state-level observations). 'migration regressions.do' is Wolfers code that I have amended for my data project. Wolfers replication files contains his original files (downloaded originally from 'https://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/data.php' under the 'Divorce Data' heading.) Outside the Code folder, you can find the clean (ish) datasets that I feed into 'migration regressions.do' to perform the actual analysis. 

For more information on this repository, the project itself, the IPUMS ACS dataset used here, and Marcen and Morales's original paper, please reach out to njrich@umch.edu. Happy econ-ing!

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of marriage regulations on the migratory behavior of individuals using the history of the liberalization of same-sex marriage across the USA. The legalization of same-sex marriage allows homosexuals’ access to legal rights and social benefits, which can make marriage more attractive in comparison to singlehood or other forms of partnership. The results clearly show that legalization increased the migration flow of gay men to states that legalized same-sex marriage. We do not detect statistically significant effects for women in the short term. Supplemental analysis, developed to explore whether the migration flow translated to a significant effect on the number of homosexuals by state, suggests that the increase after the legalization of same-sex marriage was transitory. Legalization of same-sex marriage also reduces the incentives for non-US-native individuals originating from intolerant countries to move to a state that permits same-sex marriage.},

Nevertheless, estimates from a difference-in-difference model show that the individual and joint probabilities of being employed increased among same-sex couples. Additional evidence suggests that these changes in employment were driven by improvements in attitudes and lower discrimination against sexual minorities following the introduction of marriage equality.},

This research has been largely motivated by recent changes in the legal and social environment. Research investigating these changes has been implicitly based on much older theoretical frameworks such as the sets of unitary, collective, and bargaining models of the household. These frameworks were developed to understand sources of sex-based differences in economic outcomes. The interest in understanding sex-based differentials contributes to an inherent heteronormative bias in these frameworks. This bias limits the ability of these models to explain outcomes for sexual minorities. Developing models inclusive of sexual minorities will also help the discipline better understand the dynamics of different-sex households, single-parent households, as well as households whose members hold other types of marginalized identities.},

	abstract = {I present in this paper the skeleton of a theory of marriage. The two basic assumptions are that each person tries to do as well as possible and that the "marriage market" is in equilibrium. With the aid of several additional simplifying assumptions, I derive a number of significant implications about behavior in this market. For example, the gain to a man and woman from marrying compared to remaining single is shown to depend positively on their incomes, human capital, and relative difference in wage rates. The theory also implies that men differing in physical capital, education or intelligence (aside from their effects on wage rates), height, race, or many other traits will tend to marry women with like values of these traits, whereas the correlation between mates for wage rates or for traits of men and women that are close substitutes in household production will tend to be negative. The theory does not take the division of output between mates as given, but rather derives it from the nature of the marriage market equilibrium. The division is determined here, as in other markets, by marginal productivities, and these are affected by the human and physical capital of different persons, sex ratios (that is, the relative numbers of men and women), and some other variables.},

This reduces lifetime demand for housing while freeing resources for allocation elsewhere. Therefore, gay men disproportionately sort into high-amenity locations. A ranking of metropolitan areas by their gay concentration finds high concentrations in America's most attractive cities. Regression analysis reveals that measures of local amenities predict gay location more strongly than does gay friendliness.},

This estimated impact is significantly larger for household heads in same-sex relationships. When examining the migration choices separately by both sex and relationship type, this result remains significant for female heads of households in different-sex relationships and male heads of households in same-sex relationships. Simulations, using the results of the probit estimations, the analysis of regional trends, and recent rebellions against the Supreme Court ruling indicate that state level, marriage equality laws may be aggravating the imbalanced distribution of same- and different-sex couple households across the country.},

The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects.

Our baseline estimate suggests an elasticity of roughly -0.3. For typical labor force participation ratios, an increase of 100 unemployed workers in an area is associated with net out-migration of roughly 47 workers. Instrumenting for regional unemployment produces even higher estimates. Our estimates are stable over time, inclusive of the Great Recession. The estimates depend crucially on accurate data and accounting for long-term trends in migration and unemployment.},

Unlike traditional books on the subject, INTRODUCTORY ECONOMETRICS� unique presentation demonstrates how econometrics has moved beyond just a set of abstract tools to become a genuinely useful tool for answering questions in business, policy evaluation, and forecasting environments. Organized around the type of data being analyzed, the book uses a systematic approach that only introduces assumptions as they are needed, which makes the material easier to understand and ultimately leads to better econometric practices. Packed with timely, relevant applications, the text emphasizes incorporates close to 100 intriguing data sets in six formats and offers updates that reflect the latest emerging developments in the field.},

	abstract = {Triple difference has become a widely used estimator in empirical work. A close reading of articles in top economics journals reveals that the use of the estimator to a large extent rests on intuition. The identifying assumptions are neither formally derived nor generally agreed on. We give a complete presentation of the triple difference estimator, and show that even though the estimator can be computed as the difference between two difference-in-differences estimators, it does not require two parallel trend assumptions to have a causal interpretation. The reason is that the difference between two biased difference-in-differences estimators will be unbiased as long as the bias is the same in both estimators. This requires only one parallel trend assumption to hold.},
